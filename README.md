# XMOTO_STM32

Today I would like to present you one of my projects, which was a lot of fun for me.

I had always wanted to build a stepper motor from a simple DC motor, and these small geared motors have caught my eye for a long time.

My solution is very compact and I am sure you will like it. This DC motor can be controlled by the signals direction as well as step like a normal stepper motor with driver, only that my solution already brings the driver.
